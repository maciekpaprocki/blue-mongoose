# Hello

To run the code you can either git pull or just go to :TODO

System is using decentralised compute engine called Google Chrome :) 

I didn't add any build steps ( so no corejs/babel or any other magic ) as KISS was the main principle here ( and I am lazy ), so not all the browsers are supported.

# Local development

I just used livereload to not go crazy
