# Hello

To run the code you can either git pull or just go to https://blue-mongoose.vercel.app/

System is using decentralised compute engine called Google Chrome :) 

I didn't add any build steps ( so no corejs/babel or any other magic ) as KISS was the main principle here, so not all the browsers are supported.

# Local development

I just used livereload to develop the app, so you can just run `npx livereload` in the root of the project and it will start a server on port 35729 and watch for changes in the files.
